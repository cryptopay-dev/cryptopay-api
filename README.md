This document describes the API calls available as part of the Cryptopay Payment Gateway v1 API.

If your language of choice is Ruby we recommend using the [Cryptopay gem](https://github.com/cryptopay-dev/cryptopay-ruby) instead of writing your own client.

# General API description

## Authentication

Calls that require authentication are marked with "A" in the call description title.

You can authenticate with Cryptopay by providing your API key in the HTTPS query. If your API key get compromised, you can easily reset it in [Settings - API](https://cryptopay.me/settings) tab.

All API queries must be made over HTTPS, and plain HTTP will be refused. You must include your API key in all requests.

A complete URL with API key authentication would look like this `https://cryptopay.me/api/v1/invoice?api_key=ff714265c70908645bab010c0f3bfb65`

## Base URL

The base URL for all calls is `https://cryptopay.me/api/v1/`. A complete URL would look like this `https://cryptopay.me/api/v1/invoice/3a7bc1b2-9b7e-4dc3-9ffc-b3c08962ff4d`.

## Formats and required HTTPS request headers

Cryptopay API will respond with JSON payload. It expects parameters to be passed in JSON with the correct `Content-Type: application/json` being set.

## Rate-limiting

API calls are rate-limited by IP to 6000 calls per hour.

## Pagination

Some API calls returning collections may be paginated. In this case the call description title mentions it.

Calls that return paginated data are marked with "P" in the call description title.

### HTTPS response header

Calls that return paginated collections will add a `Pagination` HTTP header to the response. It will contain a pagination meta-data JSON object.

**Pagination header example**
```javascript
    {

      // Total number of items in the collection
      "total":3,

      // Current page number
      "page":1,

      // Total amount of available pages
      "total_pages":1,

    }
```
### Controlling pagination

Optional pagination parameters may be passed in the request URI in order to control the way the collection gets paginated. If parameters are incorrect â€” HTTP 400 Bad request status will be returned along with an empty body.

| Parameter  | Default |	Acceptable values      |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|
| page      | 1       | Positive integer > 0            |
| per_page  | 20      | Positive integer >= 1  |
| from      | optional | Unix timestamp created_at > {from} |
| to        | optional | Unix timestamp created_at < {to} |



## Datetime formats

Datetime values will be returned as Unix timestamps, for example: `1392211599`

## Error handling

Whenever an error is encountered, Cryptopay response will include:

 * An HTTP 422 status (Unprocessable entity) or HTTP 400 (Bad request), HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)
 * A JSON array of localised error messages as body

## Successful calls

If API call was successful, the platform will respond with :

 * HTTP 200 status (OK) or HTTP 201 (Created),
 * JSON representation of the entity being created or updated if relevant

## Payment buttons

Payment buttons can be used to accept bitcoin for an individual item or to integrate with your existing shopping cart solution. For example, you could create a new payment button for each shopping cart on your website, setting the total and order number in the button at checkout.

### Create button (A)

Resource that creates a payment button token to accept bitcoin on your website.

**Request path :** `/api/v1/buttons`

**Request method :** `POST`

**Request parameters**

| Name                | Type    | Description                                                                  |
|---------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id                  | String  | Merchant assigned order ID                                                   |
| price               | Decimal | Requested amount to be credited upon payment                                 |
| currency            | String  | Currency in which the amount is expressed, default is EUR _(optional)_       |
| name                | String  | Order-related name _(optional)_                                              |

**Response**

A JSON object with the following parameters is returned.

**Example request :** `POST /api/v1/buttons`
```javascript  
{
  "id": "FR2348FD",
  "price": 10.3,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "name": "test"
}
```

**Example response :**
```javascript
{
  "token": "LyJ7ryzQpE6HupB7xx8R",
  "name": "test",
  "id": "FR2348FD",
  "price": 10.3,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "created_at": 1393013086,
  "callback_url": "http://yourawesomesite.com/cryptopay_handler"
}
```

Sample embed code

The button API will return a `token` parameter, which you can use to generate the embed HTML (described below).

```html
    <a href="#" class="cryptopayButton cpaGrey" data-cryptopay-token="7TWB2jAKgUntYGTjthkf"></a>
    <script src="https://cryptopay.me/assets/button.js"></script>
```

It's worth noting that generating multiple buttons this way is only necessary if you want to set prices dynamically. If you only have a few items with the same price you can generate buttons manually and modify the `data-cryptopay-token` attribute to change which value is returned in the callback.


### Buttons customizing

You can customise the button however you like. You need to make sure to include `<script src="https://cryptopay.me/assets/button.js"></script>` and that your element has `data-cryptopay-token` parameter with `token`.


### Button events handling
The best way to track payments is to use Cryptopay's [callback](#payment-callbacks), whick is fired when payment is confirmed by Bitcoin network.

If you would like to implement custom event tracking logic, you can track a `cryptopay-invoice` javascript event in `window` context.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
window.addEventListener('cryptopay-invoice', function(event){
  console.log(event.detail);
}, false);
</script>
```
This can be used, for example, to redirect the user to a 'confirmation' page where you wait for the callback to reach your site. You can obtain invoice parameters and it's status from `event.detail` object.

It's important to note that the this event does not guarantee a payment has arrived successfully (any user could trigger this javascript event on the page). It is just a convenient way to move to the next step in your checkout. You should always verify the payment was received via the callback to your site

## Payment iframes

Payment ifames can be used to accept bitcoin for an individual item without customers being redirected to an external site. For example, you could create a new ifame for each shopping cart on your website, setting the total and order number in the iframe at checkout.

### Create an iframe (A)

Resource that creates a payment button token to accept bitcoin on your website.

**Request path :** `/api/v1/iframes`

**Request method :** `POST`

**Request parameters**

| Name                | Type    | Description                                                                  |
|---------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id                  | String  | Merchant assigned order ID                                                   |
| price               | Decimal | Requested amount to be credited upon payment                                 |
| currency            | String  | Currency in which the amount is expressed, default is EUR _(optional)_       |
| name                | String  | Order-related name _(optional)_                                              |

**Response**

A JSON object with the following parameters is returned.

**Example request :** `POST /api/v1/iframes`
```javascript  
{
  "id": "FR2348FD",
  "price": 10.3,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "name": "test"
}
```

**Example response :**
```javascript
{
  "token": "LyJ7ryzQpE6HupB7xx8R",
  "name": "test",
  "id": "FR2348FD",
  "price": 10.3,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "created_at": 1393013086,
  "callback_url": "http://yourawesomesite.com/cryptopay_handler"
}
```

Sample embed code

The iframe API endpoint will return a `token` parameter, which you can use to generate the embed HTML (described below).

```html
      <div style="max-width: 605px">
      <iframe width="100%" height="300px" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" src="https://cryptopay.me/iframes/TOKEN">
      </iframe></div>
```

### iFrames customizing

You can customise the iframe however you like. For example, you can add a <border>, <box-shadow> or any other styling.


### iFrames events handling
The best way to track payments is to use Cryptopay's [callback](#payment-callbacks), whick is fired when payment is confirmed by Bitcoin network.

If you would like to implement custom event tracking logic, you can track a `cryptopay-invoice` javascript event in `window` context.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
window.addEventListener('cryptopay-invoice', function(event){
  console.log(event.detail);
}, false);
</script>
```
This can be used, for example, to redirect the user to a 'confirmation' page where you wait for the callback to reach your site. You can obtain invoice parameters and it's status from `event.detail` object.

It's important to note that the this event does not guarantee a payment has arrived successfully (any user could trigger this javascript event on the page). It is just a convenient way to move to the next step in your checkout. You should always verify the payment via the callback to your site


## Hosted page

Hosted pages can be used to accept bitcoin for an individual item or to integrate with your existing shopping cart solution. For example, you could create a new hosted page for each shopping cart on your website, setting the total and order number in the button at checkout. Your customer will be redirected to Cryptopay's page in order to complete payment.

### Allow customers to change quanity of items at the hosted checkout.

Using hosted checkout facility you can invoice for several items at once. If you want your customers to be able to choose the quantity of items they would like to purchase, you need to pass `change_quantity` parameter with value `true`

### Collect user info

You might want to collect information from your customers during the checkout process, it might be email adderess, phone number, shipping address etc. We provide several preset for you convenience:

|     Name        |  Type    | Default | Description |
|-----------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| collect_email   | Boolean  |  True   | Collect customer's email address during checkout |
| collect_phone   | Boolean  |  True   | Collect customer's phone number during checkout  |
| collect_name    | Boolean  |  True   | Collect customer's full name during checkout     |
| collect_address | Boolean  |  True   | Collect customer's address during checkout       |


In order to collect custom information you can use `form` parameter, for example `form = ['Date of Birth:', 'Tax ID']`

### Hosted page events handling

The best way to track payments is to use Cryptopay's [callback](#payment-callbacks), whick is fired when payment is confirmed by Bitcoin network.

## Cryptopay payment callbacks

When Cryptopay receives the payment, we will perform a HTTPS POST to the URL given as `callback_url`. The Content-Type for the request will be `application/json`.

The parameters sent are the same as the ones returned by a [view invoice](#view-an-invoice-a) with an extra `validation_hash` parameter.

Cryptopay IPN is expecting to get a 200 OK response from you. If it doesn't get 200 OK â€” it will keep posting callbacks on the following schedule.

Cryptopay callback is scheduled  in 5 seconds + N ** 4, where N is the number of retries.

With the default of 25 attempts, the last retry will be 20 days later, with the last interval being almost 100 hours.

**Callback handling example, PHP**

```PHP  
// Retrieving the data
$json = file_get_contents('php://input');

// Parsing the Json..
$callback = json_decode($json, true);

// You can now fetch $callback['btc_price'] for example

// HTTP response
header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
```

### Callback validation

A `validation_hash` parameter is added to all callback requests. Its purpose is to authenticate the call from Cryptopay to the callback URL. This signature **must** be properly checked by the receiving server in order to ensure that the request is legitimate and hasn't been tampered with.

The signature is computed by concatenating the Merchant API Key with an invoice UUID, price in cents (multiply of callback `price` by 100) and currency ISO code and applying a SHA1 hash function to it. You must use the following pattern: "#{merchant.api\_key}\_#{uuid}\_#{price\_cents}#{currency}"

**Example signed callback request :**

In this example the client API key is `76b7c5d75bececcef0b44f01275d1357`.
```javascript
{
   "uuid":"248e5bb8-486c-457b-a2a3-59474baded6e",
   "price_currency":"GBP",
   "description":null,
   "status":"pending",
   "btc_price":"0.0343",
   "btc_address":"1RM2o9chCxS7j7sWbtB6RR8Raa1C66evs",
   "callback_params":null,
   "id":null,
   "name":null,
   "price":"10.0",
   "currency":"GBP",
   "created_at":1393334945,
   "valid_till":1393335545,
   "validation_hash":"715d7f713372e91765078d607416b69b1d6a8795",
   "callback_url":"http://requestb.in/13lffoc1",
   "success_redirect_url":"",
   "url":"http://cryptopay.me/orders/248e5bb8-486c-457b-a2a3-59474baded6e/d",
   "bitcoin_uri":"bitcoin:1RM2o9chCxS7j7sWbtB6RR8Raa1C66evs?amount=0.0343"
}
```

Signature will be computed as: `76b7c5d75bececcef0b44f01275d1357_248e5bb8-486c-457b-a2a3-59474baded6e_1000GBP`

SHA1 hash: `715d7f713372e91765078d607416b69b1d6a8795`

This signature can be easily by doing `Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(data)` (Ruby) or `hash('sha1', $data);` (PHP) where `data` is the `#{merchant.api_key}_#{uuid}_#{price_cents}#{price_currency}`
